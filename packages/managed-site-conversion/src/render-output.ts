/**
 * Which JSX belongs to a component's own render output. This module is the one
 * statement of that boundary; every reading of a component defers to it.
 *
 * Running a function is not the same as rendering what it returns, and the
 * difference is the whole of this file. `useEffect(() => <Row />)` runs its
 * function and throws the result away; so does `setTimeout`, and so does
 * `forEach`. Reading `Row` out of any of them would hand a customer an editor
 * for markup no visitor can reach. So the question is never "is this function
 * run" but "does what it returns reach the browser as markup".
 *
 * One answer says yes: a call runs the function AND the call's own result lands
 * in rendered output — `{ITEMS.map((item) => <Card />)}`, `{(() => <Row />)()}`,
 * `return wrap(() => <Row />)`. Which call it is never matters, so no list of
 * method or hook names appears anywhere here.
 *
 * Being written as an element's attribute is NOT such an answer, though it once
 * was here. An attribute's function renders only if the element it is given to
 * renders what that function returns, and the attribute says nothing about
 * whether it does: `<button onClick={() => <Row />}>` runs the handler and
 * hands its result to the DOM, which discards it, and a component is as free to
 * take a callback it never renders — `onConfirm`, `onSelect` — as one it does.
 * Attribute spelling cannot tell those from `renderItem`, so nothing is crossed
 * on the strength of it. Where the answer is knowable it is knowable from the
 * receiving element alone, and it is always no:
 *
 *   - a host element renders no function's return value, ever. That is the JSX
 *     language rule, read through the one predicate that decides host from
 *     component, so it is derived rather than a list of handler names;
 *   - a component might, but only its own declaration says, and this reading is
 *     given one node and no way to resolve a tag to it.
 *
 * A call may run its function any number of times and in any order, so JSX
 * inside has no position of its own and only a reader that models the
 * repetition can place it. A reading that cannot model repetition takes
 * `NO_TRIGGERS` and leaves every crossing to the reader that can.
 *
 * Two answers say no, and they are not the same no:
 *
 *   - `resolved` — it provably renders nothing HERE. The result was discarded
 *     as a statement, or the call built a component out of the function
 *     (`const Card = memo(() => <div />)`), which React reaches only through a
 *     capitalized tag, or the function is a host element's attribute. Either
 *     way the answer is settled, so it is left out in silence rather than filed
 *     as a decision for a human;
 *   - `unreadable` — where it renders goes somewhere this reading cannot
 *     follow: the call's result is bound to a name, or a component was handed
 *     the function. Nothing inside is read AND the site is named, because a
 *     silent drop hides the same coverage gap as a silent inclusion.
 *
 * Component wrappers are told apart by what the call's RESULT becomes, never by
 * the callee's name, which no list of names could keep up with: a result bound
 * to a component-shaped name is a component declaration, and the tag that names
 * it is the edge. Crossing into the declaration as well would read the same
 * markup a second time, under whichever component happens to enclose it.
 *
 * One limit is worth stating plainly. `{ITEMS.filter((item) => <Row />)}` puts
 * the call's result in rendered output, but `filter` passes the items through
 * rather than what the function returned, so `Row` is read when nothing renders
 * it. Nothing in the syntax separates `filter` from `map`, and separating them
 * by name is the enumeration this module refuses. A filter written that way is
 * already broken — every item is truthy, so it filters nothing — so the cost
 * falls on code that is wrong before this tool reads it.
